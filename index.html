the gist of my thoughts:<br><br>

"i always knew the lads would be for life / <br>
but i never realized life would be so short."<br><br>

nothing i say can bring him back, but i can make sure that those around me know how much they're worth.<br><br>

this world could do with a few more 'i love you's and a little less posturing.<br><br>

"how lucky we are to have so many good memories /<br>
that i don't even remember half of them without reminder."<br><br>

passion over money. always. forever. life is too short, and too full of things to love, to spend it on things you don't even like. <br><br>

get the job done. stay real. live a life worth being proud of. <br><br>

do it for eddie.

an application of 'flight 93, revisited':<br><br>

the faithlessness of startup culture is reflective of a faithless society. neoliberalism and individualism have hollowed out any belief in collective action. our miserable substitute is 'get rich quick'. <br><br>

startup culture is sterile and dead, the pinnacle of late-stage neoliberalism: everyone uses inter, tailwind, and corporate memphis to make 'chatGPT for ___!'. idiots with degrees not worth the paper they're printed on use brand-name colleges to finesse their way into cash grabbing and exiting. <br><br>

ai itself is automating the very engines of human cognition; one must remain vigilant to keep their intellectual and creative capacities. chatgpt is a TOOL, not a permanent companion upon which to foster a cognitive dependency. too many people forget this, particularly in startup circles. <br><br>

the alt to YC decadence is company-as-holy-war, a la jobs. we must resurrect the spirit of the SDI -- we must make what children dream about when they hear the word 'technology'. <br><br> 

we will bury you, because our hearts are in it and yours are not. passion beats money, ever damn time. <br><br>

life is too short to live it in corporate memphis. <br><br>

get the job done. stay real. live a life worth being proud of. <br><br>
