the gist of my thoughts:

"i always knew the lads would be for life / 
but i never realized life would be so short."

this world could do with a few more 'i love you's and a little less posturing.

"how lucky we are to have so many good memories /
that i don't even remember half of them without reminder."

passion over money. always. forever. life is too short to spend it on money. 

get the job done. stay real. live a life worth being proud of. 

do it for eddie.
