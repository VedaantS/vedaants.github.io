the gist of my thoughts:<br><br>

"i always knew the lads would be for life / <br>
but i never realized life would be so short."<br><br>

nothing i say can bring him back, but i can make sure that those around me know how much they're worth.<br><br>

this world could do with a few more 'i love you's and a little less posturing.<br><br>

"how lucky we are to have so many good memories /<br>
that i don't even remember half of them without reminder."<br><br>

passion over money. always. forever. life is too short, and too full of things to love, to spend it on things you don't even like. <br><br>

get the job done. stay real. live a life worth being proud of. <br><br>

do it for eddie.
